** Compatibility
*Guarateed compatibility with Firefox 119.0.1*

This theme is strictly meant for Windows 10, use on linux, mac or older windows OS may have unintended results.

It should work on newer versions as well unless there's any breaking changes in how ~userChrome.css~ works.

I have only tested this for Windows 10. There might be some bugs on Linux or MacOS because the window decorations look different. I can't test this because I don't have a Linux or Mac operating system, but if you find any bugs and know how to fix it, feel free to submit a PR.

** How to install
- Go to ~about:config~ in your URL bar, search for ~toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets~ and set it to ~true~.
- Go to ~about:profiles~ in your URL bar, click /"Open Directory"/ next to your Root Directory under your default profile.
- If there is no ~chrome~ folder, create it.
- Create a file called ~userChrome.css~ inside the ~chrome~ folder.
- Copy and paste the contents of ~userChrome.css~ into your file.
- Create a folder called ~titlebuttons~ inside the ~chrome~ folder.
- Download, then copy and paste the ~.svg~ files from within the ~titlebuttons~ folder into the folder you created.
- Install the [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/][Sidebery]] extension.
- Make sure to enable /"Allow this extension to run in Private windows"/ so you're not left stranded while browsing.
- Go to ~about:addons~ in your URL bar, select *the three small dots next to Sidebery*
  Click on *Help* in thye left navigation panel
  - Import Addon Data
  - Select the *sidebery-data.json* file located in this github
- Restart Firefox.

** Things to note
- For those still having the white window controls, you need to choose the Dark theme from Themes (in about:addons), and not Settings.
