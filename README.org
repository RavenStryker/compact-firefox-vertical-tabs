** Compatibility
*Guarateed compatibility with Firefox 104.*

This theme is strictly meant for Windows 10, use on linux, mac or older windows OS may have unintended results.

It should work on newer versions as well unless there's any breaking changes in how ~userChrome.css~ works.

I have only tested this for Windows 10. There might be some bugs on Linux or MacOS because the window decorations look different. I can't test this because I don't have a Linux or Mac operating system, but if you find any bugs and know how to fix it, feel free to submit a PR.

** How to install
- Go to ~about:config~ in your URL bar, search for ~toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets~ and set it to ~true~.
- Go to ~about:profiles~ in your URL bar, click /"Open Directory"/ next to your Root Directory under your default profile.
- If there is no ~chrome~ folder, create it.
- Create a file called ~userChrome.css~ inside the ~chrome~ folder.
- Copy and paste the contents of ~userChrome.css~ into your file.
- Create a folder called ~titlebuttons~ inside the ~chrome~ folder.
- Download, then copy and paste the ~.svg~ files from within the ~titlebuttons~ folder into the folder you created.
- Install the [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabcenter-reborn/][Tab Center Reborn]] extension.
- Make sure to enable /"Allow this extension to run in Private windows"/ so you're not left stranded while browsing.
- Go to ~about:addons~ in your URL bar, select *Tab Center Reborn*, go to
  *Preferences* and set:
  - *Animations*: Off.
  - *Use current browser theme*: On.
  - *Compact Mode*: Enabled.
  - *Favicon-only pinned tabs*: Off.
  - Activate *Custom Stylesheet* and paste the contents of ~tabCenterReborn.css~ into the text area below, and click /"Save CSS"/ under the text box.
- Restart Firefox.

** Things to note
- If the sidebar does not show up, you can press =Shitft-F1= to show the Tab Center Reborn sidebar directy. Or add the icon to your menubar through the customization menu.
- In Fullscreen mode, the sidebar will collapse to a 0px wide border instead to be as unintrusive as possible. You can expand it by pushing your cursor all the way to the edge of the screen.
- Use =ctrl+T= to create a new tab or double click in an empty area. Use =ctrl+W= to close out of your active tab.
